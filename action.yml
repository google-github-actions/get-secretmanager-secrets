  Get secrets from Google Secret Manager and make their results available as
  output variables.

inputs:
  secrets:
    description: |-
      List of secrets to access and inject into the environment. These are
      comma-separated or newline-separated `OUTPUTNAME:SECRET`. Output names or
      secret names that contain separators must be escaped with a backslash
      (e.g. `\,` or `\\n`) unless quoted. Any leading or trailing whitespace is
      trimmed unless values are quoted.

      ```yaml
      secrets: |-
        output1:my-project/my-secret1
        output2:my-project/my-secret2
      ```

      Secrets can be referenced using the following formats:

      ```text
      # Long form
      projects/<project-id>/secrets/<secret-id>/versions/<version-id>

      # Long form - "latest" version
      projects/<project-id>/secrets/<secret-id>

      # Short form
      <project-id>/<secret-id>/<version-id>

      # Short form - "latest" version
      <project-id>/<secret-id>
      ```
    required: true

  min_mask_length:
    description: |-
      Minimum line length for a secret to be masked. Extremely short secrets
      (e.g. `{` or `a`) can make GitHub Actions log output unreadable. This is
      especially important for multi-line secrets, since each line of the secret
      is masked independently.
    required: false
    default: '4'

  export_to_environment:
    description: |-
      Make the fetched secrets additionally available as environment variables.
    required: false
    default: false

  encoding:
    description: |-
      Encoding in which secrets will be exported into outputs (and environment
      variables if `export_to_environment` is true). For secrets that cannot be
      represented in text, such as encryption key bytes, choose an encoding that
      has a safe character such as `base64` or `hex`. For more information about
      available encoding types, please see the [Node.js Buffer and character
      encodings](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html#buffers-and-character-encodings).
    required: false
    default: 'utf8'

  universe:
    description: |-
      The Google Cloud universe to use for constructing API endpoints. The
      default universe is "googleapis.com", which corresponds to
      https://cloud.google.com. Trusted Partner Cloud and Google Distributed
      Hosted Cloud should set this to their universe address.
    required: false
    default: 'googleapis.com'

outputs:
  secrets:
    description: |-
      Each secret is prefixed with an output name. The secret's resolved access
      value will be available at that output in future build steps. For example:

      ```yaml
      jobs:
        job_id:
          steps:
          - id: 'secrets'
            uses: 'google-github-actions/get-secretmanager-secrets@v3'
            with:
              secrets: |-
                token:my-project/docker-registry-token
      ```

      will be available in future steps as the output:

      ```text
      steps.secrets.outputs.token
      ```
